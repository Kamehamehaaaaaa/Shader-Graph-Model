# Shader-Graph-Model
A shader graph designed and imported onto an open-source model

**Project Description:**
In this Unity project, I explored the fundamentals of Unity's Shader Graph and designed a shader graph known as Hologram which was imported onto an open-source Monkey model. The node-based shader editor enables the creation of diverse visual effects without the need for custom shader coding. This project mainly involved creating a glowing shader effect using a Fresnel node, time-based animation to pulsate the highlight dynamically, and introducing the process of using properties like occlusion maps to enhance the realism of materials.
